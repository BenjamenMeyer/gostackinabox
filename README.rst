Testing framework for HTTP-based APIs

========
Overview
========

This is a port of ``StackInABox`` (https://github.com/TestInABox/stackInABox) to Golang.
The Service design is slightly different to accomodate how Golang works and the fact that
some things are built-in to Golang that are not in Python.
